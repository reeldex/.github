# Welcome to ReelDex! ðŸ‘‹

**Navigating the world of cinema, one API call at a time.**

ReelDex is a collection of open-source projects dedicated to building a fast, modern, and reliable service for movie information. Our goal is to create a distributed system that provides a powerful API and a simple, clean web interface for discovering and exploring films.

---

### ðŸš€ Our Mission

We believe that accessing movie data should be simple and efficient. Our mission is to develop a set of tools that are:

*   **Fast & Scalable**: Built on a distributed architecture to handle data and requests effectively.
*   **Developer-Friendly**: Featuring a well-documented, intuitive REST API for developers to build upon.
*   **Open & Accessible**: A community-driven project with open access to both the tools and the data.

### âœ¨ What We're Building

The ReelDex ecosystem is comprised of several key components that work together:

*   **A Distributed Backend**: A network of microservices responsible for collecting, processing, and storing movie data.
*   **A Public API**: The core of ReelDex, offering public endpoints to query our movie database.
*   **A Web Interface**: A clean and simple web application to search, browse, and view movie details.

### ðŸ“‚ Our Repositories

We're just getting started, but here are the core repositories that will be hosted under this organization:

*   `reeldex-api`: The primary repository for our movie data API.
*   `reeldex-web`: The frontend application for browsing the movie catalog.
*   `reeldex-infra`: Code and configuration for our infrastructure and deployment pipelines.
*   `.github`: This very repository, containing our community health files and organization profile.

### ðŸŒ± Get Involved

This project is currently in its early stages. We're excited to build in the open and will be sharing updates as we make progress. Stay tuned!
